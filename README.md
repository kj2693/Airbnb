In our study, we began by collecting quarterly Airbnb data, delving into exploratory data analysis with key graphs. We addressed missing values, separated datasets for training and testing, and engineered features for our model selection. Three models were chosen for their balance between interpretability and accuracy. After model tuning and evaluation, we applied the models to predict revenue. Analyzing coefficients, we derived actionable insights. As we move forward, our focus shifts to cost-benefit analysis and providing strategic insights to hosts for revenue optimization across diverse categories and neighborhoods.
